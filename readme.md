FurAffinity TidyProfile
=========

This is a simple userscript for automatically shortening the length of profile content on FurAffinity (Works on both Classic and Beta).<br>


## Features
- Automatically shortens profile content text if the container stretches beyond a reasonable size. The remaining content will still load, but be held in a scrollable container so the page isn't stretched to a insane length.

## Changelog
<b>1.0.0</b> (2016-09-11)<br>
- Initial commit.
